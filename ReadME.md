# 📝 My To-Do List App

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple single-page **To-Do List web application** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, delete them, and even displays cloned tasks for demonstration purposes.  

The project was developed as part of an SBA (Standards-Based Assessment) to demonstrate DOM and BOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and form validation.
